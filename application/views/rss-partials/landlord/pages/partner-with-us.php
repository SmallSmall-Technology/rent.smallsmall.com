						<b>1.</b> We verify all tenants diligently, check their IDs, referees, employment status, and income proofs. (Visit their place of work if we still have doubts)<br /><br />

						<b>2.</b> We provide premium rent insurance through AXA Mansard.<br /><br />

						<b>3.</b> Our payment gateway has direct debit authorization on tenants bank account and we save you the stress of chasing tenants for rent.<br /><br />

						<b>4.</b> We collect equivalent of 1 month rent as security deposit from tenants which goes to you(owner) if tenant breaches contract, cause damage or default.<br /><br />

						Unlike 6 months eviction period for yearly rent, monthly rent is 1 month eviction period according to Lagos Tenancy Law.<br /><br />

						<b>5.</b> From electrical to plumbing – we provide an oversight for home maintenance, repair and installation works at no cost to you. Only pay for materials and workmanship pre-approved/approved by you. We’ll also inspect your property regularly.<br /><br />

						<b>6.</b> Every time a tenant moves out, we inspect the house thoroughly to assess the condition of the property and submit a report to you.<br /><br />

						<b>7.</b> We draft a professional, legally-vetted rental agreement that covers all the terms and conditions of the nature of the contract. And we go further to handle legal matters related to the tenancy.<br /><br />

						<b>8.</b> Prospective tenants can immediately schedule appointment to inspect property, pay immediately to reserve property, go through our verification and approval process, all on our online platform.<br /><br />

						<b>9.</b> We don’t charge agency fee or legal fee separately. Our service fee is the commission we get from rent+markup. It’s lower than what rental agents charge.<br /><br />

						<b>10.</b> To give you property the best visibility in the market we do free professional photo-shoot.
