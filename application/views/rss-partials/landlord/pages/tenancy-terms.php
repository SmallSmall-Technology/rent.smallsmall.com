					<strong>Agreement (Contract)</strong><br /><br />

					This document contains Rent Small Small’s general property letting terms and is applicable to all persons booking a property on RentSmallSmall platform. A personalized property engagement agreement will be prepared between Rent Small Small and a prospective Occupant which will include the general terms and specific terms which characterize the property a tenant reserves for his occupation.<br /><br />
					
					<strong>Rent confirmation by Owner</strong><br /><br />

					A prospective tenant/licensee/lessee of a property listed on the Rent Small Small Platform is required to provide certain documents for verification purposes within 24 hours of reserving a property for occupation. The move-in date may be extended where an Occupant is unable to present the required document within the above stipulated time.<br /><br />

					Upon a satisfactory verification process, the property owner shall confirm the letting of the property as reserved by the prospective tenant/licensee/lessee. No person other than the property owner or his appointed agent may confirm or decline the letting of a property reserved by a prospective Occupant. Where a property owner declines a property reservation made by a prospective Occupant, the property letting will be cancelled immediately and the prospective tenant/licensee/lessee may elect to let another property on the Platform or claim a full refund of all monies advanced via the Platform for the Letting.<br /><br />

					Where a User provides invalid documents for any process on the Platform, RentSmallSmall shall reject such invalid documents and extend the Move-in date for re-submission of the required documents by the User. The renting of the reserved property will not be cancelled by RentSmallSmall, however the Move-in date will be extended for up to 15 days to enable the User provide all the required documents as all documents shall be provided by the User no later than 48 hours before the Move-in date.<br /><br />

					In the event where a User is an existing Occupier desirous to move into another listed property, the terms relating to documentation and property owner verification shall apply.<br /><br />

					However, where a listed property does not require property owner verification prior to Move-in by an Occupier, the standard documentation procedure above shall apply. <br /><br />

					<strong>Notice Period & Minimum Stay</strong><br /><br />

					An Occupier may terminate a property letting agreement only in accordance with the terms of the personalized letting agreement between the Occupier and the Property Owner or his duly authorized agent. However, an early termination of the property letting agreement by an Occupier will attract a termination penalty. An Occupier who terminates a property letting contract before the full term of the contract will forfeit the Security Deposit paid as well as unused rent already paid for the month in which the Occupier terminates. Properties listed on the Platform are available for letting for the under-listed terms;
 
						<li>1 month</li>
						<li>3 months</li>
						<li>6 months</li>
						<li>9 months and</li>
						<li>12 months</li>

					Upon termination of a property letting contract, the Occupier is obliged to pay all outstanding rents, rates, any penalties accrued in respect of late payment of rent, property maintenance charges and such other amounts accrued over the property which remained unpaid at the date of termination.

					Security Deposit <i class="fa fa-angle-down"></i>

				</div>

				<div class="acordion-content" id="content-four">

					The Security Deposit is a financial guarantee given by Occupier to the property owner against breach of contract, damages to the property, and outstanding payment on the property. The Security Deposit is calculated on the basis of One month’s rent over the demised property. A prospective Occupier will pay the Security Deposit to Rent Small Small before the commencement of the property letting in accordance with the property letting agreement. Where a prospective occupier fails to pay the Security Deposit, the property reservation process will not be complete and can thus not move into the property nor pay rent in respect of the selected property.<br /><br />

					Where an existing Occupier chooses to move into another property listed on the Platform, but with a higher rental value, the difference between the current rent payable by the Occupier and the new property will be paid to Rent Small Small to update the Security Deposit. The same procedure will apply where an Occupier elects to move into a property with a lesser rental value.<br /><br />

					Deposit Payment Terms
					
					<li>Tenant needs to pay one month of rent as security deposit.</li>
					<li>Tenant is required to pay the full security deposit, at the time of booking.</li>
					<li>The security deposit paid is stated in the tenancy agreement.</li>
					<li>Security deposit must be paid online along with the rent.</li>
					<li>In the case where a tenant chooses to make an internal transfer or upgrade his/her current rent type, the difference in the amount of security deposit will be expected to be paid by the tenant before him/her making the actual transfer. In case the new rent is lower, the difference in Naira is adjusted against the following month’s rent.</li>

					<strong>Open Guest Hosting</strong>

					RentSmallSmall has an open guest policy, but if you’re living in a shared house or block of flats, you need to be responsible and considerate about your co-tenants when you host your guests. So, here are a few initiatives you can take to make this peaceful.<br /><br />

					Have a word with your co-tenant about your little gig and get their consent. Have it recorded, (it could be a simple message on SMS, Whatsapp, or anything, essentially something you can use as proof) so that there is no blame game, should there be any consequences in the future.<br /><br />

					As you must be aware, RentSmallSmall partners with certain estates that are governed by policies of the Estate Association. Make sure you take recorded consent of the estate association in addition to that of the co-tenant if hosting a party or event in your flat.<br /><br />

					We believe in having fun responsibly. Please avoid the risks of mishaps so that you don’t get into a position you don’t want to be in. Also, in case of financial losses incurred, you will sadly have to bear it.
