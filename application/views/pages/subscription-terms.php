              This document contains Subscription fee Rent Small Small’s general property subscription terms and is
              applicable to all persons booking a property on Rentsmallsmall platform. A personalized property
              engagement agreement will be prepared between Rentsmallsmall and a prospective Subscriber which will
              include the general terms and specific terms which characterize the property a subscriber reserves for his
              subscription.

            <p class="">
              A prospective subscriber of a property listed on the RentSmallSmall Platform is required to provide
              certain documents
              for verification purposes within 24 hours of reserving a property for subscription. The move-in date may
              be extended
              where a Subscriber is unable to present the required document within the above stipulated time.
              Upon a satisfactory verification process, the property owner shall confirm the subscription of the
              property as reserved
              by the prospective subscriber. No person other than the property owner or his appointed agent may confirm
              or decline the
              subscription of a property reserved by a prospective Subscriber. Where a property owner declines a
              property reservation
              made by a prospective Subscriber, the property subscription will be cancelled immediately and the
              prospective subscriber
              may elect to let another property on the Platform or claim a full refund of all monies advanced via the
              Platform for the
              Subscription. Where a User provides invalid documents for any process on the Platform, Rentsmallsmall
              shall reject such
              invalid documents and extend the Move-in date for re-submission of the required documents by the User. The
              subscription
              of the reserved property will not be cancelled by Rentsmallsmall, however the Move-in date will be
              extended for up to 15
              days to enable the User provide all the required documents as all documents shall be provided by the User
              no later than
              48 hours before the Move-in date. In the event where a User is an existing Subscriber desirous to move
              into another
              listed property, the terms relating to documentation and property owner verification shall apply. However,
              where a
              listed property does not require property owner verification prior to Move-in by a Subscriber, the
              standard
              documentation procedure above shall apply.

              A Subscriber may terminate a property subscription agreement only in accordance with the terms of the
              personalised
              subscription agreement between the Subscriber and the Property Owner or his duly authorised agent.
              However, an early
              termination of the property subscription agreement by a Subscriber will attract a termination penalty. A
              Subscriber who
              terminates a property subscription before the full term of the Subscription will forfeit the Security
              Deposit paid as
              well as unused subscription fee already paid for the month in which the Subscriber terminates. Properties
              listed on the
              Platform are available for subscription for the under-listed terms;

              Upon termination of a property subscription, the Subscriber is obliged to pay all outstanding subscription
              fees, service
              charges, rates, any penalties accrued in respect of late payment of subscription fee, property maintenance
              charges and
              such other amounts accrued over the property which remained unpaid at the date of termination.

            <h2 class="terms-sub--title" id="security">4. Security Deposit</h2>
            <p class="">
              The Security Deposit is a financial guarantee given by Subscriber to the property owner/legal
              representative against
              breach of Subscription, damages to the property, and outstanding payment on the property. The Security
              Deposit is
              calculated on the basis of one month or two months of subscription fee as stated on the property details
              subscription
              fee over the demised property. A prospective Subscriber will pay the Security Deposit to RentSmallSmall
              before the
              commencement of the property subscription in accordance with the property subscription agreement. Where a
              prospective
              subscriber fails to pay the Security Deposit, the property reservation process will not be complete and
              can thus not
              move into the property nor pay subscription fee in respect of the selected property. Where an existing
              Subscriber
              chooses to move into another property listed on the Platform, but with a higher subscription value, the
              difference
              between the current fee subscription fee payable by the Subscriber and the new property will be paid to
              RentSmallSmall
              to update the Security Deposit. The same procedure will apply where a Subscriber elects to move into a
              property with a
              lesser subscription value. Deposit Payment Terms

              the difference in the amount of security deposit will be expected to be paid by the subscriber before
              him/her making the
              actual transfer. In case the new subscription fee is lower, the difference in Naira is adjusted against
              the following
              month’s Subscription fee.

              Rentsmallsmall has an open guest policy, but if you’re living in a shared house or block of flats, you
              need to be responsible and considerate about your co-subscribers when you host your guests. So, here are a
              few initiatives you can take to make this peaceful.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Have a word with your co-subscriber about your little gig and get their consent. </li>
              <li>Have it recorded, (it could be a simple message on SMS, Whatsapp, or anything, essentially something
                you can use as proof) so that there is no blame game, should there be any consequences in the future.
              </li>
              <li>As you must be aware, Rentsmallsmall partners with certain estates that are governed by policies of
                the Estate Association. Make sure you take recorded consent of the estate association in addition to
                that of the co-subscriber if hosting a party or event in your flat. We believe in having fun
                responsibly. Please avoid the risks of mishaps so that you don’t get into a position you don’t want to
                be in. Also, in case of financial losses incurred, you will sadly have to bear it.</li>
